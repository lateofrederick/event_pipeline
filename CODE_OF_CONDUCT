Code of Conduct for Nexus

1. Purpose
This project exists to build useful software in a welcoming, respectful environment. The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to set clear expectations for participant behavior and to help maintain an inclusive community.

2. Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (repositories, issue trackers, mailing lists, chat rooms, conferences, and other events) and to all project participants, including maintainers, contributors, and visitors.

3. Expected Behavior
- Be respectful, courteous, and patient.
- Assume good faith and give others the benefit of the doubt.
- Use inclusive language and avoid jokes or comments that could exclude or offend.
- Offer constructive feedback and accept criticism graciously.
- Respect project decisions and follow community processes.

4. Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form.
- Derogatory comments about race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, or nationality.
- Threats of violence, stalking, bullying, or repeated unwanted contact.
- Deliberate sabotage of project work, doxxing, or sharing private information.
- Sexual language or imagery in project spaces where it is not appropriate.
- Persistent disruptive behavior after being asked to stop.

5. Reporting
If you experience or witness a violation, report it to the project maintainers:
- Preferred: send an email to conduct@nexus.org (replace with the actual contact).
- Alternative: open a private issue or contact a core maintainer directly.
Include: date/time, location (repository/issue/chat), names or handles involved, and a brief description. Attach screenshots or logs if helpful.

6. Enforcement
Maintainers will review reports confidentially and act to resolve issues fairly and promptly. Possible actions include:
- Verbal or written warning.
- Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces.
- Removal of offending content or contributions.
- Escalation to relevant authorities if there is imminent danger.

7. Appeals
If you are subject to enforcement action and believe it was unjust, you may appeal by contacting an alternate maintainer or a designated appeals contact listed in the project README.

8. Acknowledgements
This Code of Conduct is intended to foster a safe, productive, and welcoming project community. Maintainers may update it as needed; changes will be announced in the project repository.
